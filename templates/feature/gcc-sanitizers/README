This template adds gcc-sanitizers and the development libraries
(libasan-dev, liblsan-dev, libtsan-dev, libubsan-dev).

The GCC sanitizers are available for x86, x86-64, and ARM targets.
However, hardware-assisted address sanitizer (HWASan) is specifically supported only on the AArch64 architecture.
This information is detailed in the documentation provided at the following link:
https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Instrumentation-Options.html#index-fsanitize_003dhwaddress


To use, add

--templates feature/gcc-sanitizers

as a setup option.
