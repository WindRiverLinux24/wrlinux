This template restores the Wind River Linux handling of network interface names that
was in effect for LTS23 and earlier releases.

Historically, Wind River Linux creates links to /dev/null in
/etc/systemd/network/80-wired.network and /etc/udev/rules.d/80-net-setup-link.rules.
This overrides the default files which are in /lib/systemd/net and /lib/udev/rules.d.

The default 80-net-setup-link.rules renames network interfaces with "predictable" names
based on their physical characteristics.  The default 80-wired.network configures all
"wired" network interfaces not previously configured to use DHCP to obtain IP assignments.

This means the default Wind River Linux behavior has been to require specifying IP information
on the boot command line, or to force the user to create *.network files for interfaces he
wishes configured by systemd.  In addition, the kernel assigned interface names will be
retained.  Specifying IP configuration on the boot command line, or using an nfs root
filesystem will disable 80-wired.network actions and cause renaming by 80-net-setup-link.rules
to fail.

To invoke this template, include

WRTEMPLATE:append = " feature/no-pni-names"

in local.conf before building.
